    <h4>RESTORING AND PROTECTING YOUR TEETH</h4>
    <p>When your teeth sustain substantial damage such as chipping, breakage, or decay, then you need a trained dental professional to aid in the healing and restoration process. We at Leaside Village Dental can apply porcelain crowns to your compromised teeth to protect them from further damage. Crowns are also commonly used to guard your teeth following a root canal procedure.
    </p>
    <p>If you are missing teeth and experiencing issues with your bite or teeth placement, our expert team at Leaside Village Dental can address those concerns with custom-made bridges. Your dental bridge will be individually created to fit properly into your mouth and sufficiently fill gaps left by missing teeth.

</p>

    <p>The positive attributes of our dental crowns and bridges include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Individualized fit</li>
      <li>Durability and longevity</li>
      <li>Naturally colored and shaped</li>
      <li>Alleviated biting and chewing issues</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For any questions or concerns about our dental crowns and bridges, reach out to our Leaside Village Dental team by calling 647-346-3368 today!</p>
