    <h3>DENTURES IN TORONTO, ON</h3>
    <p>
	Missing teeth may make you want to hide your smile, but Leaside Village Dental might have you displaying
	your pearly whites again. We offer quality dentures, and we'll work hard to fit you with a comfortable set that
	makes eating and drinking pleasurable again. We're accepting new patients, and we invite clients throughout Toronto
	to take advantage of our services.
    </p>
    <p>
	When you visit our office, we'll perform an exam to determine whether you need a full set or partials. We can also
	repair existing dentures if the need arises.
    </p>
    <h4>PARTIAL DENTURES</h4>
    <p>
	At Leaside Village Dental, we recognize that no two mouths are alike. When you come to us for partial dentures, we'll take the time to evaluate the state of your teeth and come up with a treatment plan specifically for you. You'll get our full attention during every appointment, and you'll be given the opportunity to ask questions and discuss any concerns you might have.    
    </p>
    <h4>FLEXIBLE DENTURES</h4>
    <p>
Made of durable nylon resin, flexible dentures are one of the most cost-effective, comfortable tooth replacement solutions available today. Tooth replacement with flexible dentures is non-surgical. And compared to other types of dentures, flexible dentures are often thought to be more cosmetically pleasing, easier to wear, and more durable. Now that’s something to smile about.    
    </p>
    <h4>DENTURE REPAIR</h4>
    <p>At Leaside Village Dental, we understand how important your dentures are to you. That's why we aim to provide prompt, professional denture repair services so that you’re out the door and back to your busy schedule as quickly as possible. </p>
    <h4>IMPLANT-SUPPORTED DENTURES</h4>
    <p>
	At Leaside Village Dental, we understand that tooth loss and jawbone deterioration can take a toll on your appearance, your health, your comfort level, and your self-esteem. That's why we offer implant-supported dentures to eliminate movement of the dentures, improve chewing and most importantly, stop the continuous loss of bone that happens after teeth are lost.</p>
    <h4>RESTORING SMILES</h4>
<p>Our goal is to improve your overall oral health. In our efforts to do so, we'll provide personalized, care that's designed to address your specific concerns. We're in our Toronto, ON, office every day but Monday, and we offer convenient hours. Give Leaside Village Dental a call when you're considering dentures. We'll help you review your options.</p>
