    <h4>Restore Your Smile!</h4>
    <p>If you have issues with crooked or misaligned teeth or bite issues, then our oral care professionals at Leaside Village Dental may recommend Invisalign treatment. The Invisalign system includes a series of virtually invisible, clear aligners which are custom-made for you and will gradually move your teeth into the correct position.</p>
    <p>Unlike traditional braces, Invisalign uses no metal or wires to irritate your mouth. They can be removed as needed to eat and for regular hygiene. We encourage you to visit our dental office for a consultation, and our team will determine if Invisalign treatment is right for you.</p>
    <p>There are multiple benefits to our Invisalign treatment such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Completely non-metal</li>
      <li>Nearly invisible to the eye</li>
      <li>Removable at your convenience</li>
      <li>Gradually fixes crooked smiles and bites</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To learn more about Invisalign or to schedule a consultation, contact us at 647-346-3368 today!</p>
