    <h4>A FOCUS ON PATIENT EDUCATION</h4>
    <p>
    At Leaside Village Dental, we believe that a big part of children&apos;s dentistry
    involves teaching patients how to properly care for their teeth. Many children learn their
    most important oral hygiene habits by visiting our practice, including:
      <ul>
        <li>
            Brushing
        </li>
        <li>
            Flossing
        </li>
        <li>
            Avoiding Tooth Decay
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    But Leaside Village Dental does more than just teach children about proper oral care.
     Our team of dedicated dental professionals goes the extra mile to provide thorough treatment
      when our patients need it the most. To learn more about our children&apos;s dentistry services or to
       schedule an appointment, call us today.
