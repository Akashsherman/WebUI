    <h4>WHAT IS PERIODONTICS?</h4>
    <p>The inflammation of the gums is known as periodontal disease. In a healthy mouth, the tissue of the gum will tightly fit around the tooth. When gum disease occurs, tissue begins to pull away. If left untreated, this can cause further damage including destruction of the tooth and bone supported by the gum. Gum disease has also been linked to overall health including conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.</p>
    <h5><b>Scaling and Root Planing:</b></h5>
    <p>Scaling and Root Planing is a common treatment for the treatment and removal of plaque and tartar deposits under the gums. This deep cleaning consists of two parts. Scaling is the removal of the plaque and tartar above and below the gumline, cleaning all the way down to the bottom of the pocket. Root planing involves smoothing out the teeth roots to help your gums reattach to your teeth and prevent future issues. Scaling and root planing may take more than one visit to complete and may require a local anesthetic. After this treatment, the tissues become healthier and less inflamed due to decreased amounts of bacteria under the gums.</p>
    <p>Gum disease is a serious condition that should be addressed quickly. Schedule your appointment today by calling 647-346-3368.</p>
