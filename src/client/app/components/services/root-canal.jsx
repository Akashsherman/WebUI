    <h4>PROTECTING YOUR TEETH FROM DECAY AND INFECTION</h4>
    <p>At Leaside Village Dental, we are dedicated to the health of our patients. If you are suffering from a severe toothache, it could be an infection in the root canal. You are not alone. Millions of teeth are treated and saved each year with root canal or endodontic, treatment.</p>
    <p>Inside your tooth, under the enamel is a soft tissue called pulp. This contains blood vessels, nerves and connective tissue. The pulp extends from the crown of the tooth to the tip of the roots. Root canal treatment is necessary when the pulp becomes inflamed or infected.</p>
    <p>During a root canal treatment, the dentist will remove the inflamed or infected pulp, clean and shape the inside of the root canal, then fills and seal the space. Finally, a crown will be placed on the tooth to protect and restore it to full function. After restoration, the tooth will function like any other tooth.</p>
    <h4>DON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR TEETH</h4>
    <p>
	Even if your teeth seem badly diseased, we may be able to help. If we determine that you're a good candidate for root canal therapy, we'll take the time to explain the procedure and answer any questions you might have about your treatment. And during your appointment, you'll benefit from our thorough approach.
