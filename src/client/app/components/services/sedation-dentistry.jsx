    <h4>SEDATION DENTISTRY</h4>
    <p>At Leaside Village Dental, we understand that some patients are uncomfortable about the dentist; therefore in addition to local anesthesia, we offer laughing gas to our patients for certain procedures.</p>
    <br />
    <p><b>Local Anesthesia:</b> Local anesthesia is used to prevent pain in a specific area of your mouth by blocking the nerves that sense or transmit pain. In some cases, a topical anesthetic is used to numb an area before administering an injectable local anesthetic. Local anesthesia may be used for filling cavities, preparing teeth for crowns or treating gum disease.</p>
    <p><b>Laughing Gas:</b> This sedative is a great option to make patients more comfortable during certain procedures. When receiving laughing gas through a mask, you will breathe normally through your nose, and within a few minutes, you will feel the effects. Laughing gas will not put you to sleep. You may feel light-headed or tingly. Ultimately, you will feel comfortable and calm. The effects will wear off quickly once the mask is removed.</p>
    <br />
    <p>At Leaside Village Dental, we make your comfort a priority. To learn more, call us at 647-346-3368 to make an appointment.</p>
