    <h4>TEETH WHITENING</h4>
    <p>Teeth whitening procedures are used to brighten the appearance of a patient’s smile – sometimes by as many as 5 to 10 shades in a single session.Professional teeth whitening services can be performed in an office setting or prescribed for take-home use by a patient. In comparison to over-the-counter teeth whitening treatments, professional whitening uses stronger whitening agents that deliver faster and more effective results.</p>
    <h5><b>Did you know…</b></h5>    
    <p>Teeth naturally darken as we age? Furthermore, certain foods, beverages, medications and habits can contribute to a darker, yellowed, or stained smile. However, it is possible to erase years of stains in a single professional whitening session and sustain those results for many years with proper maintenance.</p>
    <br />
    <h5><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h5>
    <p><b>Am I a Candidate for Teeth Whitening?</b></p>
    <p>You may be a candidate for professional teeth whitening if you are experiencing discoloration, but otherwise have healthy teeth and healthy gums. Schedule a consultation with Leaside Village Dental to find out if tooth whitening could be right for you. Some patients, such as those who are pregnant or sensitive to whitening agents, may not be candidates for professional whitening.</p>
    <p><b>What Should I Expect When I Get My Teeth Whitened?</b></p>
    <p>Before whitening, we will protect your gums, and then apply a whitening agent to the surface of your teeth. The product will be activated and left on the teeth for several minutes before being rinsed off. Your results will vary according to the natural shade of your teeth and degree of discoloration, but it is normal for patients to experience a lightening of several shades in a single visit.</p>
    <p><b>What Type of Post-Treatment Care is Required After Having My Teeth Whitened?</b></p>
    <p>It is normal to experience some tooth sensitivity following a professional whitening treatment. You may be instructed to avoid consuming highly pigmented beverages for at least 24 hours to prevent the teeth from becoming stained again. Examples include tea, coffee and wine. Depending on your results and long-term teeth whitening goals, you may also be sent home from your procedure with an at-home whitening kit for later use.</p>
